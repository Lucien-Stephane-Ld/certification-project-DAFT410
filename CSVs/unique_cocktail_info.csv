370,Bourbon Old-Fashioned,"The timeless Bourbon Old Fashioned is a classic cocktail that has captivated drinkers for over 200 years. Despite its simple recipe of whiskey, sugar, water, and bitters, the drink remains popular and relevant today.For history enthusiasts, the Old Fashioned can be linked to the first recorded definition of a cocktail in the early 1800s. It embodies the key elements of that definition, making it a fascinating connection to the past. However, if you're eager to enjoy the drink without the historical context, feel free to skip the lesson and indulge in its flavors.When making a Bourbon Old Fashioned, it's crucial to use high-quality bourbon. Mediocre whiskey won't do justice to this cocktail, which highlights the spirit's character. Now, there are two schools of thought when it comes to sweetening the drink: simple syrup or muddled sugar.While using a barspoon of simple syrup may save time, it alters the drink's texture and depth. For a more authentic 19th-century experience, opt for granulated sugar or a sugar cube. If you prefer a modern twist, simple syrup is an option, but be mindful of the additional water it introduces to the drink. Adjust your ice and stirring accordingly.Once you've mastered the Bourbon Old Fashioned, feel free to experiment with variations using rye whiskey or other spirits like rum or brandy. The drink is a versatile template open to interpretation. However, the bourbon-spiked version has stood the test of time, so why deviate from perfection? Stick to the beloved classic.","In a mixing glass, combine the sugar and bitters. Add water and stir until the sugar is almost dissolved.Fill the mixing glass with ice and pour in the bourbon. Stir the mixture until it becomes well-chilled.Strain the mixture into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.Take an orange twist and gently squeeze it over the glass to release the oils. Drop the twist into the glass as a garnish."," | 1 teaspoon: sugar | 3 desh: Bitters | 1 teaspoon: water | 2 ounces: bourbon - or rye whiskey, if preferred",Calories: 161kcal | Carbohydrates: 5g | Fat: 0.01g | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 1mg | Sugar: 4g | Calcium: 0.2mg | Iron: 0.02mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

695,Black Russian Cocktail,"The Black Russian is a straightforward and classic cocktail that consists of just two ingredients: vodka and Kahlúa, a coffee liqueur made with rum, sugar, and arabica coffee. It was invented in the late 1940s by bartender Gustave Tops at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels.Legend has it that Tops created the drink for Perle Mesta, the American ambassador to Luxembourg, who happened to be visiting the bar. The name of the cocktail is a simple reflection of its ingredients: Kahlúa, which is black in color, and vodka, which is commonly associated with Russia (despite Kahlúa actually being produced in Veracruz, Mexico). During that time, with the Cold War looming, the dark and mysterious Black Russian embodied the spirit of the era.While the Black Russian is not as well-known today as its descendant, the White Russian, which incorporates cream, it has paved the way for numerous variations. The White Russian gained popularity in the 1960s and became even more famous thanks to its appearance in the film ""The Big Lebowski"" in 1998. However, the Black Russian remains a classic cocktail that has inspired countless innovations. For example, the Colorado Bulldog adds cola to the White Russian, while the Mudslide incorporates Irish cream. These drinks owe their existence to Tops' original combination of vodka and Kahlúa.Making a Black Russian is incredibly easy, making it an ideal choice for home mixing. Simply stir the ingredients with ice and strain the liquid into a glass. This recipe produces a fairly dry version of the cocktail and serves as a great starting point. If you prefer a sweeter drink, you can adjust the proportions by adding more Kahlúa and reducing the amount of vodka to suit your taste.","Fill a rocks glass with ice.

1054,Classic Screwdriver,"The Screwdriver is a timeless cocktail that has earned its status as an official cocktail of the International Bartender Association. While the exact origin of the Screwdriver is debated, it has been mentioned in literature as early as 1949, during the rise of vodka's popularity in the United States.There are a few stories surrounding the drink's origin. Some credit American aviators for popularizing the Screwdriver, while others claim it gained popularity among American oil workers in the Persian Gulf, who allegedly mixed vodka with orange juice and used a screwdriver to stir it when a spoon was unavailable. Although these origin stories may be questionable, it's easy to imagine this simple two-ingredient beverage being created independently in various places around the same time. After all, the concept of mixing fruit juice with a spirit was not new, considering the popularity of the Mimosa with sparkling wine and orange juice.The beauty of the Screwdriver lies in its simplicity and its role as a morning eye-opener. Combining vodka and orange juice in a highball glass requires minimal effort and creates a versatile base for experimentation. This simplicity has paved the way for other cocktails like the Harvey Wallbanger and Fuzzy Navel, which build upon the Screwdriver's foundation.Next time you're hosting a brunch or in need of a refreshing pick-me-up, try this classic version of the Screwdriver. Rediscover why this cocktail has become an essential part of any cocktail drinker's repertoire and enjoy its easy-drinking appeal.","Fill a highball glass with ice, then add the vodka.Top with the orange juice.", | 1 1/2 ounces: vodka |: Orange juice,Calories: 98kcal | Sodium: 0.4mg | Potassium: 0.4mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

1736,Dark ‘n Stormy,"The Dark 'n Stormy is a flavorful and refreshing cocktail that combines dark rum, ginger beer, and lime. It is a popular drink enjoyed worldwide, known for its smooth and easy-to-drink qualities. Similar to the Moscow Mule, this cocktail offers a great option for vodka drinkers looking to try something new.The origins of the Dark 'n Stormy are uncertain, but it is believed to have been concocted by sailors who appreciated the combination of rum and the soothing effects of ginger. The key ingredient in this cocktail is Gosling's Black Seal rum, a rich and flavorful rum from Bermuda with hints of caramel, vanilla, and spice. In fact, Gosling's rum is the only rum that can be used in a Dark 'n Stormy, as the company successfully trademarked the drink name.It's important to note that ginger beer, not ginger ale, should be used in the Dark 'n Stormy. Ginger beer has a stronger ginger flavor and spicier bite compared to ginger ale, which enhances the richness of the rum. While some recipes include lime juice for an added citrus kick, it is optional, and the traditional serving style in Bermuda includes just rum, ginger beer, and a lime wedge for individual squeezing.Whether you choose to add lime juice or stick to the classic ingredients, the Dark 'n Stormy is a delicious and satisfying cocktail that is sure to please. Just make sure to use Gosling's Black Seal rum to experience the authentic Dark 'n Stormy flavor.",Pour Ginger beer in to highball glass over ice.Add ice.Float Goslings Black Seal Rum on top.Garnish with lime wedge and enjoy., | 2 oz: Rum |: Ginger beer,Calories: 141kcal | Carbohydrates: 2g | Sodium: 3mg | Potassium: 1mg | Sugar: 2g | Calcium: 1mg | Iron: 1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

2290,French 75 Cocktail,"The French 75 is named for the fast-firing 75 millimeter field gun that was utilized by the French during World War One. Consisting of gin, fresh lemon juice, sugar and Champagne, the drink is a lot friendlier than the name implies.Like many classic drinks, the French 75’s origin is mired in mystery and debate. According to drinks historian David Wondrich, the recipe first appeared in 1927 at the height of Prohibition in a book called “Here’s How” that was published by a New York humor magazine. The cocktail was soon immortalized in 1930 in the pages of Harry Craddock’s “The Savoy Cocktail Book,” which solidified the French 75’s spread in bars and homes around the world.How it was invented, however, is less clear. It’s likely that the drink cannot be attributed to one person, and instead, was the simple product of experimentation. Discerning drinkers in the 19th and early 20th centuries were known to combine gin and Champagne, a duo well-suited to sugar and lemons. But when the combination was given the French 75 moniker, its fate was sealed as a classic.That said, it’s possible that the first French 75s didn’t contain gin at all. Cognac and Champagne were also fast friends, and some recipe books call for cognac in place of gin. This much is certain: Both spirits make an excellent French 75, so mix whichever version you prefer.Today the French 75 is a fixture in cocktail bars, but it’s also a fan-favorite during brunch. The effervescent drink offers a boozier kick than a Mimosa, while still providing ultimate refreshment before, during and after your eggs Benedict. Whenever you choose to drink the French 75—and whichever spirit you choose as its base—this is one classic you’ll want to rediscover again and again.","Vigorously shake the gin, lemon juice and sugar syrup with ice,Pour or strain into a tall glass .Add the champagne and stir.", | 1 oz: Gin | 1 oz: Lemon Juice | 1 oz: Sugar Syrup | 4 oz: Champagne,Calories: 204kcal | Carbohydrates: 15g | Protein: 0.2g | Sodium: 4mg | Potassium: 153mg | Fiber: 0.1g | Sugar: 11g | Vitamin C: 19mg | Iron: 0.7mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

2301,Gin and Tonic,"The Gin & Tonic, a seemingly simple two-ingredient cocktail, demands attention to detail for the perfect mix. Balancing the right ratio of gin to tonic is crucial to avoid overpowering one element with the other.Experimentation is key when it comes to creating the ideal Gin & Tonic. With a wide variety of gins and tonics available, you can find the combination that suits your taste preferences. London dry gins feature a juniper-forward profile, while modern-style gins emphasize citrus and florals. Tonics range from dry and bitter to sweet and syrupy, offering a spectrum of flavors. Garnishes also play a role, with lime, lemon, grapefruit, or herbs like rosemary adding their own unique touch.The versatility of the Gin & Tonic allows for creative twists. Muddled cucumbers, fruit, dry vermouth, liqueurs, fresh herbs, and even barrel-aged gin can enhance the experience. This beloved cocktail has come a long way since its origins, where quinine powder was mixed with soda and sugar as an antimalarial remedy for British soldiers. Today, tonic has evolved to complement gin, resulting in a harmonious pairing.So, raise your glass to the Gin & Tonic, appreciating its historical roots and celebrating the endless possibilities it offers. Whether sipped for enjoyment or as a nod to its medicinal beginnings, this classic cocktail remains a timeless favorite.

2515,Gibson,"The Gibson is a classic Martini variation that stands out with its unique garnish of a pickled onion. Made with gin and dry vermouth, this cocktail offers a savory twist to the traditional Martini experience.While the exact origin of the Gibson is uncertain, it is believed to have been created by Walter D.K. Gibson in the late 1800s at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco. The cocktail appeared in William Boothby's 1908 book, omitting the use of bitters that were common in early Martinis. The signature cocktail onion became associated with the Gibson in later years.Traditionally, gin is the spirit of choice for a Gibson, but vodka has also become popular as preferences evolved. The choice between the two spirits allows you to tailor the character of your Gibson. Gin brings a dry and bracing quality, while vodka takes a more subdued role, allowing the other ingredients to shine.One way to elevate your Gibson is by making your own pickled onions. This simple process involves soaking or cooking cocktail onions in a brine of vinegar, sugar, and pickling spices. Homemade pickled onions provide a fresh and crunchy garnish, adding depth and complexity to your drink compared to store-bought alternatives. Once you have your pickled onions ready, all you need is gin, dry vermouth, and you can enjoy the distinct flavors of this classic Martini variation.Experiment with the Gibson to find your preferred balance of gin or vodka, vermouth, and the delightful tang of pickled onions. Cheers to enjoying this timeless cocktail with its distinctive twist.",Stir Gin and vermouth over ice cubes in a mixing glass. Strain into a cocktail glass.

2521,Gimlet,"The classic Gimlet is a wonderfully simple and refreshing cocktail that consists of gin, fresh lime juice, and sugar. Categorized as a gin sour, it shares a category with other beloved and time-tested drinks like the Daiquiri, a rum sour.The exact origin of the Gimlet remains uncertain, but it is believed to have been invented by British sailors in the late 18th century out of necessity. The sailors needed a way to prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C, so they mixed lime juice with liquor. It didn't take long for them to realize that this concoction was not only beneficial but also incredibly delicious. Thus, while scurvy is now a thing of the past, the Gimlet continues to thrive.Over time, the Gimlet found its way into cocktail books, including Harry Craddock's iconic ""The Savoy Cocktail Book"" from 1930, featuring various recipes, ingredients, and proportions. While fresh lime juice is the preferred choice today, for many years, the Gimlet was predominantly made with Rose's lime cordial, a bottled mixture of lime juice and sugar that debuted in the 1860s. If you opt for Rose's in your drink, you can omit the simple syrup since the cordial is already sweetened. Aim for one ounce of Rose's to achieve the desired balance.It's worth noting that the Gimlet can also be made with vodka, a practice that gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. However, as gin reclaimed its popularity among drinkers, it regained its rightful place in the Gimlet. Gin's natural affinity for lime, along with its dry and botanical nature, adds structure to the cocktail while keeping the sweetness in check. The result is a harmonious blend of flavors that is both refreshing and satisfying.","Pour the Gin and lime juice into a mixing glass half-filled with ice cubes.

2536,Hurricane Cocktail,"The Hurricane cocktail is a bold and vibrant drink that packs a flavorful punch. Invented in the 1940s at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans, it was originally created as a solution to a surplus of rum. Today, Pat O'Brien's continues to serve this popular cocktail, selling over half a million glasses each year.The Hurricane is made with two types of rum, lime juice, orange juice, passion fruit puree, grenadine, and simple syrup. Its sweet and fruity profile makes it a favorite choice for parties and celebrations. While variations of the drink exist, using fresh ingredients such as citrus, quality passion fruit, and homemade grenadine enhances the overall balance and helps temper its sweetness.Drinking a Hurricane is an experience in itself, often enjoyed from a Hurricane glass. This tall and wide vessel, inspired by hurricane lamps, adds to the fun and festive atmosphere. While traditionally served in a Hurricane glass, it's also common to see the drink served in disposable plastic cups in New Orleans' French Quarter, where public alcohol consumption is permitted.

3169,Lemon Drop Cocktail,"The Lemon Drop cocktail made its debut in San Francisco in the 1970s, created by Norman Jay Hobday, a Vietnam veteran turned saloon owner. It quickly became popular, capturing the taste buds of bar-goers with its delightful blend of vodka, citrus, and sugar. The drink's fame reached new heights when Oprah served it to Rachael Ray on her show, solidifying its place in popular culture.Often mistaken as a Martini, the Lemon Drop's closest relative is actually the Crusta, a New Orleans creation from the 1850s. What sets the Lemon Drop apart is its sugared rim, which adds an extra touch of sweetness. Coating the rim with sugar may take an extra minute, but it's a step worth taking for the delightful sensation it adds to each sip.While the Lemon Drop is typically served in a cocktail glass, it can also be enjoyed as a shot. Using fresh lemon juice and simple syrup yields the best results, enhancing the cocktail's signature flavor. Although bottled sweet and sour mix can be used as a substitute, fresh ingredients provide a superior taste and reduce the likelihood of a rough morning after.Although the Lemon Drop lends itself well to experimentation, it's recommended to try the classic version first. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless appeal, so savor it in its original form before exploring other variations.If you like this you might also like the Lemon Drop Shot",Woops...

3172,Midori Illusion Cocktail Recipe,"The Midori Illusion cocktail is a refreshing and colorful drink that is made with Midori melon liqueur and a combination of other ingredients. It is a popular choice at bars and parties, and is known for its sweet and fruity flavor.This cocktail is a product of the shooters fad that began in the 1990s. As its name suggests, the Midori Illusion or Melon Illusion. The recipe here calls for a double shot of Melon Liqueur, but this amount makes enough to fill several large shot glasses, so be sure to share the end result around. The vodka, on top of the already plentiful MIDORI, gives this cocktail an extra kick, but the pineapple juice makes for a mellow taste with pleasantly sour undertones.","Shake ingredients with ice, and strained over fresh ice a glass", | 2 oz:(56.7 ml) Melon Liqueur | .5 oz:(14.17 ml) Vodka | .5 oz:(14.17 ml) Triple Sec | 2 oz:(56.7 ml) Pineapple Juice | 1 oz:(28.35 ml) Lemon Juice,Calories: 264kcal | Carbohydrates: 35g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 3mg | Potassium: 74mg | Sugar: 32g | Vitamin C: 16.7mg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yeOGX_3eJI?feature=oembed
3173,Miami Vice Cocktail,"Contrary to popular belief, the Miami Vice cocktail was not inspired by the iconic television series. This tropical drink, a delightful combination of a Strawberry Daiquiri and a Piña Colada, predates the show by several years. However, its name and presentation undeniably evoke the vibrant Miami atmosphere.The Miami Vice has always found its home in two settings: nightclubs and beach bars. Even as the popularity of sweet, frozen drinks from the '80s and '90s has waned, tropical cocktails continue to reign supreme in beachside resorts and vacation destinations, serving as a fun and delicious reminder that you're on a holiday.To create a Miami Vice, you'll need to prepare two separate cocktails. The Strawberry Daiquiri is made with rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and fresh strawberries, blended with crushed ice until smooth. On the other hand, the Piña Colada combines rum, pineapple juice, and cream of coconut, also blended with crushed ice until smooth.Now that you have both cocktails prepared, it's time to combine them. While the order doesn't affect the taste, the typical presentation involves pouring the Strawberry Daiquiri into the glass first, followed by the Piña Colada. This creates a visually striking layered effect and offers the drinker a delightful choice. Sip from the bottom for a taste dominated by the Daiquiri, sip from the top for a creamy coconut experience, or mix them together to enjoy the harmonious blend of two beloved tropical cocktails. There are no wrong answers here—it's all about personal preference.Although it may be tempting to use ready-made mixes, it's best to resist that urge. By sticking to fresh fruits, freshly squeezed juice, and quality rum, your Miami Vice will truly shine in both taste and appearance. Just like the iconic white jackets, V-necks, and loafers from the television show, this cocktail will make a memorable impression.","In a blender, add 1 ounce of the rum, strawberries, lime juice, simple syrup and 1 cup crushed ice and blend until smooth.Pour into a hurricane glass and set in the freezer.Wash and dry the blender thoroughly.In the clean blender jar, add the remaining 1 ounce of rum, cream of coconut, pineapple juice and 1 cup crushed ice and blend until smooth.Pour into the hurricane glass that already contains the Strawberry Daiquiri, creating a layered effect.Garnish with a pineapple slice.", | 2 ounces: rum - divided | 1 cup: strawberries - chopped | 1 ounce: lime juice - freshly squeezed | 1/2 ounce: simple syrup | 2 ounces: cream of coconut | 2 ounces: pineapple juice,Calories: 500kcal | Carbohydrates: 71g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 10g | Saturated Fat: 9g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 0.1g | Sodium: 40mg | Potassium: 350mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 62g | Vitamin A: 35IU | Vitamin C: 104mg | Calcium: 38mg | Iron: 1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

3605,Paper Plane,"The Paper Plane may seem like a long-standing classic cocktail, but it was actually invented in 2008 by bartender Sam Ross.

It quickly gained popularity and found its way to New York City, where it was served at Milk & Honey and gained a loyal following.When making the Paper Plane, Ross suggests using a slightly higher-proof bourbon to add body to the drink. It's important not to overshave the cocktail to maintain its coldness without diluting it too much. With equal parts of each ingredient, it's an easy cocktail to make at home.The Paper Plane showcases the flavors and balance of the ingredients. It's a great introduction to whiskey for those new to the spirit, as the bourbon presence is not overpowering. Despite its relatively recent creation, the Paper Plane has made a significant impact in the cocktail world and is likely to remain a beloved drink for years to come.","Fill a shaker with ice.Add the bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino, and lemon juice to the shaker.Shake the ingredients vigorously until the shaker is well-chilled.Strain the mixture into a coupe glass.Optionally, you can garnish the cocktail with a lemon twist or a small paper plane for a playful touch.", | 3/4 ounce: bourbon | 3/4 ounce: Aperol | 3/4 ounce: bitter liqueur | 3/4 ounce: lemon juice,Calories: 204kcal | Carbohydrates: 11g | Protein: 0.1g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.01g | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 23mg | Fiber: 0.1g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 1IU | Vitamin C: 8mg | Calcium: 1mg | Iron: 0.03mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

3609,Paloma,"The Paloma is a refreshing and delicious cocktail that rivals the Margarita in its popularity and iconic status among tequila drinks. As the national drink of Mexico, the Paloma boasts an authentic pedigree that adds to its appeal.What sets the Paloma apart is its simplicity. With just three ingredients—tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda—it's hard to go wrong. Unlike Margaritas, which can vary greatly in quality and balance, Palomas offer a foolproof recipe that hits all the right notes. When you're in the mood for a refreshing and well-rounded cocktail that can be prepared in no time, the Paloma's highball construction makes it a surefire winner.Although Palomas are effortless to make, they deliver a surprisingly complex flavor profile. Traditionally, blanco tequila is used, but lightly aged reposado tequila also works wonderfully. It's advisable to reserve the añejo expression for sipping, as its rich oak influence can overpower the clean and invigorating taste of a Paloma.In Mexico, Jarritos is the go-to grapefruit soda for its widespread availability, lively carbonation, and the delightful sweetness derived from sugar cane. If Jarritos isn't readily accessible, other suitable options include Squirt, Ting, or Fresca. Whichever grapefruit soda you choose, it's worth considering whether to rim the glass with salt or add a pinch of salt directly into the drink. While not essential, this step adds a savory element that beautifully complements the earthy tequila and tangy grapefruit. For an extra kick, experiment with spiced salts like Tajín.The beauty of the Paloma lies in its simplicity. You don't need any special bar tools to make it. Just grab a highball glass, add ice, pour in the tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda, give it a quick stir, and voilà! You're ready to savor the refreshing flavors of Mexico's national cocktail. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply seeking a delightful libation, the Paloma is a fantastic choice that can be enjoyed any day of the year.",Combine ingredients in a highball.Add ice.Garnish with a grapefruit wheel and enjoy., | 2 oz: Tequila | 1 oz: Lime Juice | 1 Pinch: Salt |: Grapefruit Soda,Calories: 151kcal | Carbohydrates: 6g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Sodium: 40mg | Potassium: 80mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 16IU | Vitamin C: 16mg | Calcium: 6mg | Iron: 1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

3994,Rusty Nail Cocktail,"The Rusty Nail, a cocktail that once held great popularity, has somewhat faded from bar menus and fallen out of favor among patrons. The drink is a simple combination of scotch whisky and the scotch-based liqueur Drambuie, with the name derived from Gaelic meaning ""the drink that satisfies.""The origins of the Rusty Nail are shrouded in mystery and subject to debate. Many believe it was invented in 1937 for the British Industries Fair trade show. The cocktail also appears in the 1967 edition of the ""Old Mister Boston Official Bartender's Guide,"" a renowned cocktail book of the post-Prohibition era. A similar drink called the Little Club #1 can be found in Ted Saucier's 1951 book, ""Bottoms Up.""By the late 1960s, the Rusty Nail had gained popularity in bars in New Orleans and New York, with the phrase ""Have you tried a Rusty Nail?"" becoming common. Some credit the bartenders at the 21 Club in Manhattan, known for creating the B & B cocktail (half Bénédictine and half cognac), with inventing the Rusty Nail around the same time. While this claim is difficult to substantiate, it is plausible given the establishment's creativity with cordials and liquors.Legend has it that the Rat Pack, including members like Frank Sinatra, had a fondness for the Rusty Nail, which may have contributed to its widespread appeal during that era. In the 1970s, the drink was a popular choice in many New York bars, including P.J. Clarke's, a favorite haunt of Sinatra.As with many classic cocktails, the recipe for the Rusty Nail varies widely. Some suggest a two-to-one ratio of scotch to Drambuie, while others recommend equal parts. Modern variations tend to be drier, with ratios like four parts whisky to one part liqueur. It is also possible to substitute bourbon for scotch, creating a Rusty Spike. However, the classic Rusty Nail is timeless, and the two-to-one ratio will always serve as an excellent representation of the drink.",Fill a chilled rocks glass with ice cubes.

4004,Rum Runner Cocktail,"The Rum Runner is a classic tropical cocktail that originated in the 1950s at Holiday Isle, a Tiki bar in Islamorada, Florida. It features rum, banana liqueur, grenadine, and blackberry liqueur, which gives it a unique flavor profile with hints of tannins.Over the years, various versions of the Rum Runner have emerged, and no two recipes are exactly the same. Different fruit juices like lime, orange, and pineapple are commonly used, either individually or in combination.

4009,South Side Cocktail,"The South Side is a cocktail with a bit of a mysterious background, leading to varying descriptions and interpretations among bartenders and cocktail historians. Some consider it a Mint Gimlet served in a cocktail glass, while others view it as a gin-based Mint Julep served over ice. The origins of the drink's name are also debated, with some attributing it to Chicago's South Side neighborhood and others suggesting its creation at the Southside Sportsmen's Club on Long Island. Despite the uncertainty, one thing is clear: the South Side is a classic cocktail that deserves recognition and enjoyment for its refreshing combination of gin, citrus, sugar, and mint.The recipe for the South Side can be traced back to at least 1916 when it appeared in Huge Enslinn's book ""Recipes for Mixed Drinks"" under the name South Side Fizz. Enslinn's version included gin, lemon and lime juices, sugar, mint, and club soda. Over time, variations emerged, with some recipes omitting the club soda and one of the citrus fruits, resulting in the South Side we know today.While the 21 Club in New York is often associated with popularizing the South Side, it is unlikely to be its place of origin, as the bar did not open until 1922. The exact creation story remains elusive, but the 21 Club's contribution to the cocktail's popularity is undeniable.When preparing the South Side, it is important to handle the mint gently. Over-muddling can release bitter flavors instead of the desired sweet and aromatic qualities. Double-straining the drink, using a fine-mesh sieve, ensures a smooth texture and prevents any torn mint bits from ending up in your glass and causing inconvenience. Experiment with both lemon and lime to find your preferred citrus profile, though the traditional recipe calls for lemon juice.","Add the mint leaves and lemon juice into a shaker and gently muddle.Add the gin and simple syrup with ice, and shake until well-chilled.Double-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.Garnish with a mint sprig.", | 5: mint leaves | 1 ounce: lemon juice - freshly squeezed | 2 ounces: gin | 1 ounce: simple syrup,Calories: 108kcal | Carbohydrates: 12g | Protein: 0.1g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.01g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.02g | Sodium: 9mg | Potassium: 38mg | Fiber: 0.2g | Sugar: 11g | Vitamin A: 107IU | Vitamin C: 6mg | Calcium: 9mg | Iron: 1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

4094,Sidecar,"With a rich century-long history, the Sidecar stands as one of the most renowned classic cognac cocktails, cherished by cocktail enthusiasts to this day. This dry and tangy libation combines cognac, orange liqueur, and fresh lemon juice, accompanied by a sugared rim. It is a direct descendant of the Brandy Crusta, an antique New Orleans cocktail that has experienced a resurgence in recent times.The Sidecar likely originated during World War I and made appearances in cocktail books such as Harry MacElhone's ""Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails"" and Robert Vermeire's ""Cocktails and How to Mix Them"" in 1922. The original recipe called for equal parts cognac, Cointreau, and lemon juice, but subsequent versions adjusted the ratios to two parts cognac, one part Cointreau, and one part lemon. This revised formula remains popular today.While the sugared rim is optional, it adds a delightful touch to the Sidecar, complementing its dry profile with occasional bursts of sweetness. The drink's name has sparked debates, with claims from both a French and English bar attributing it to a customer arriving in a sidecar of a motorcycle. Alternatively, bar veteran Dale DeGroff suggests that the name refers to the extra mixture left in the shaker, served in a shot glass on the side, known as a sidecar.Serving a shot alongside your Sidecar not only adds a playful touch but also allows you to share the cocktail's origin story. Whether you opt for the sidecar or not, this classic concoction is sure to please and captivate with its timeless allure.",Shake ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

4244,Sea Breeze Cocktail,"The Sea Breeze is a beloved cocktail that became an icon of 1980s drinking, perfect for enjoying sunny days at the beach with its light and refreshing profile. This cocktail features vodka, cranberry juice, and grapefruit juice, often grouped with other popular drinks of the era like the Cape Codder and the Bay Breeze. While these cocktails share common ingredients, the Sea Breeze has a history all its own.Although the Sea Breeze gained significant popularity in the 1980s, its origins can be traced back several decades in a different form. In Harry Craddock's renowned 1930 book, ""The Savoy Cocktail Book,"" there's a recipe for the Sea Breeze Cooler. This earlier version includes equal parts dry gin and apricot brandy, along with lemon and grenadine, served over ice, topped with club soda, and garnished with mint. While different from the modern Sea Breeze, many believe this serves as the foundation for its evolution. Interestingly, the change in recipe may be attributed to clever marketing by a cranberry consortium.In the 1960s, Ocean Spray, originally a growers' collective founded in 1930, started promoting cranberries through recipe booklets, encouraging their use in various foods and drinks, including cocktails. One of the featured cocktails was named the Sea Breeze and included cranberry juice, possibly marking the first appearance of cranberry in the popular drink.Today, the Savoy's Sea Breeze Cooler has faded into relative obscurity, replaced by the modern version with vodka. This cocktail remains a favorite due to its thirst-quenching and delicious nature, while also being incredibly easy to make. Bottled cranberry juice remains a popular choice, as fresh juice can be too tart on its own. However, using freshly squeezed grapefruit is always a great idea, as its vibrant citrus notes contribute to the cocktail's refreshing and invigorating qualities.Whether you're actually on the beach or simply trying to evoke beach vibes with your drink, the Sea Breeze is here to help. This cocktail is conveniently built in the glass you drink it from, making it the easiest way to bring sunny weather to your enjoyment. So sit back, relax, and sip on a Sea Breeze—it's the perfect way to enjoy a taste of sunshine.","Pour Vodka, Grapefruit Juice and Cranberry Juice into a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

4443,Vodka Salty Dog,"Despite its name, the Salty Dog is a cocktail that offers a friendly and approachable drinking experience. This classic drink is a variation of the Greyhound, a cocktail consisting of gin or vodka mixed with grapefruit juice. What sets the Salty Dog apart is its salted rim, which gives the drink its unique identity.The Greyhound cocktail dates back to at least 1930 when it appeared in Harry Craddock's ""Savoy Cocktail Book."" Originally a simple combination of gin, grapefruit, and ice, the Greyhound has remained relatively unchanged over the years. However, the public's preference for vodka over gin has led to variations of the cocktail, including the Salty Dog. The addition of a salted rim and a new name distinguishes this savory twist on the classic.The Salty Dog is believed to have emerged in the 1950s, possibly credited to a gentleman named George Jessel. Its purpose was to balance the tart and bitter notes of grapefruit by incorporating salt. Salt is not only used for seasoning food; it is also a popular ingredient in cocktails. Whether applied to the rim or added to the drink itself, salt brings together the various components of cocktails like the Salty Dog, Margarita, and Paloma.When making a Salty Dog, it's important to choose your ingredients wisely. Since the cocktail only consists of two liquid components, the quality of your chosen spirit and grapefruit juice is paramount. Opt for a good-quality gin or vodka, as the base spirit will be discernible in each sip. Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice will provide a more vibrant and flavorful citrus profile, avoiding the overly sweet or artificial taste often found in packaged alternatives.",Pour ingredients into a highball glass over ice cubes. stir well. and serve., | 5 oz: Grapefruit Juice | 1.5 oz: Vodka | 1/4 tsp: Salt,Calories: 163kcal | Carbohydrates: 16g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 0.1g | Sodium: 593mg | Potassium: 230mg | Fiber: 0.1g | Sugar: 16g | Vitamin A: 10IU | Vitamin C: 38mg | Calcium: 12mg | Iron: 1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

4456,Vesper,"The Vesper, also known as the Vesper Martini, is a cocktail created by author Ian Fleming for his famous character James Bond. Introduced in Fleming's novel Casino Royale in 1953, the drink is named after the fictional double agent Vesper Lynd, who is a love interest of Bond.When Bond orders his signature drink, he specifies the exact ingredients and preparation method: ""A dry martini. One. Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel.""While traditional Martini recipes are typically stirred, the Vesper is shaken due to its higher alcohol content. With four ounces of liquor and an additional half-ounce of Lillet, the shaking process helps dilute the drink, making it more palatable.The decision to shake the Vesper may also serve a literary purpose, emphasizing Bond as a strong and hard-drinking secret agent. The vigorous shaking ensures the drink is ice-cold, masking the taste of the alcohol as it goes down.Bond claims to never have more than one drink before dinner, but he prefers that drink to be substantial. However, if you prefer a less potent cocktail, you can reduce the volume while maintaining the original proportions of the ingredients.Whether you choose to enjoy a full-strength Vesper or a lighter version, the cocktail offers a glimpse into Bond's sophisticated and daring lifestyle, making it a classic choice for Martini enthusiasts and fans of the iconic secret agent.","Shake well until ice cold, strain into a deep wine goblet.", | 3 oz: Dry Gin | 1 oz: Vodka | .5 oz: White Vermouth,Calories: 273kcal | Carbohydrates: 1g | Protein: 0.01g | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 2mg | Iron: 0.03mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

4459,Vodka Martini Cocktail,"Though cocktail purists may insist that gin is the only proper way to make a Martini, the Vodka Martini’s enduring popularity shows that not all agree. While gin will open added dimensions of aroma and flavor to create a more complex cocktail profile, using vodka as the base spirit will create a cleaner drink that allows the subtler notes of vermouth to more effortlessly come through.There’s no definitive origin story to who first popularized swapping gin for vodka in a classic Martini—the list of claims is too long to be worth going into detail—but the practice grew in the mid-20th century as efforts increased to grow vodka’s acceptance in the U.S. market. he spirit was often described to unfamiliar consumers as “white whiskey” or “flavorless gin,” and found an audience in those seeking cocktails with lighter profiles.Consequently, in the ensuing years, substituting vodka for gin in an array of formerly gin-based cocktails became mainstream. For the Martini, this practice perhaps reached its peak of visibility after Ian Fleming’s fictional spy James Bond first enjoyed a “medium dry vodka martini…shaken not stirred” in the 1962 film version of Dr. No. (Notably, in the original novel Casino Royale, Bond’s preferred specifications for what’s now known as a Vesper Martini called for both gin and vodka, with a heaver proportion of gin).Regardless of its murky origins and rise to fame, the Vodka Martini is still a popular Martini variation that will work well for drinkers who seek a clean, straight-forward cocktail that doesn’t overwhelm the palate with overly complex flavors. Vodka can also provide something of a blank canvas for those seeking to experiment with the growing array of dry vermouth options on the market. Without the weight of gin’s often juniper-heavy notes dominating the cocktail, vermouth’s often more herbal and citrus-forward notes have room to stand and be better appreciated on their own.Here's how to make a classic Vodka Martini.",Shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass., | 3 oz: Vodka | 1 oz: White Vermouth,Calories: 219kcal | Carbohydrates: 1g | Protein: 1g | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 1mg | Iron: 1mg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgxLKPKaiTk?feature=oembed

4636,Aviation Cocktail,"The Aviation cocktail has a rich history, originating in the early 1900s and making a comeback thanks to the revival of crème de violette liqueur. Initially disappearing from the market in the 1960s, crème de violette's reintroduction in 2007 by Haus Alpenz brought the Aviation back into the spotlight.This floral gin cocktail combines gin, maraschino liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and the distinct crème de violette. The gin provides a solid foundation, maraschino liqueur adds bittersweet cherry notes, and lemon brings a necessary touch of acidity. Crème de violette, with its strong floral character, must be used sparingly to avoid overpowering the drink.While Rothman & Winter's crème de violette is a popular choice, other violet liqueurs like Creme Yvette, The Bitter Truth, and Giffard offer their own unique profiles that work well in the Aviation.Though some argue that the violet liqueur is essential for an authentic Aviation, variations without it have also found favor over the years. However, to experience the original recipe, the purple-hued liqueur is a must.Let's celebrate the revival of crème de violette, ensuring that the Aviation and other violet-based cocktails remain a vibrant part of the cocktail scene. Cheers to never living in a world without the magic of crème de violette! 🍸💜","Add all the ingredients to a shaker and fill with ice.Shake, and strain into a cocktail glass.Garnish with a cherry if desired.", | 2 oz: Gin | .5 oz: Cherry Liqueur | .25 oz: Crem De Violette | .75 oz: Lime Juice,Calories: 176kcal | Carbohydrates: 8g | Protein: 0.1g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.01g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.03g | Monounsaturated Fat: 0.004g | Sodium: 2mg | Potassium: 28mg | Fiber: 0.1g | Sugar: 7g | Vitamin C: 9.1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

4637,Mint Julep,"The Mint Julep, famously associated with the Kentucky Derby, is a bourbon cocktail worth savoring beyond race day. Comprised of bourbon, sugar, mint, and crushed ice, this refreshing drink has a rich history dating back to the 18th century in the southern United States.Documented in John Davis' book in 1803, the Mint Julep was described as a morning libation enjoyed by Virginians, consisting of a spirit infused with mint. Originally, juleps encompassed a broader category of drinks made with various spirits and crushed ice, including cognac and peach brandy. However, after the phylloxera epidemic, bourbon became the preferred base for this beloved concoction.Traditionally, the Mint Julep is served in a rocks glass or, ideally, a silver julep cup. Choosing a high-quality bourbon that suits your taste is essential since it's the star of the drink. Opting for a slightly higher-proof bourbon helps maintain the cocktail's integrity as the crushed ice slowly melts.This recipe, shared by San Diego bartender Erick Castro, guarantees a refreshing experience. Don't limit yourself to enjoying a Mint Julep solely on Derby Day—indulge in this classic cocktail whenever the mood strikes and discover how a few simple ingredients can create the ultimate refreshment.","In a Julep cup or rocks glass, gently muddle the mint leaves with the simple syrup to release their aromatic oils.Add the bourbon to the glass, and stir to combine with the mint and syrup.Fill the glass tightly with crushed ice, packing it all the way to the top.Stir the mixture vigorously, allowing the glass to frost on the outside.Top the drink with additional crushed ice to form a domed shape over the rim of the glass.Garnish with a fresh mint sprig, gently placing it in the ice dome.For an optional touch, add a few drops of bitters on top of the ice dome.Sip and savor the refreshing Mint Julep, letting the flavors of mint, bourbon, and sweetness meld together.", | 8: Mint Leaves | 1/4 ounce: Simple Syrup | 2 ounces: Bourbon Whiskey,Calories: 156kcal | Carbohydrates: 6g | Protein: 0.3g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.02g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 0.04g | Sodium: 7mg | Potassium: 51mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 5g | Vitamin A: 340IU | Vitamin C: 3mg | Calcium: 20mg | Iron: 1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

4638,Bee’s Knees Cocktail,"The Bee's Knees is a classic cocktail from the Prohibition era, combining gin, lemon juice, and honey. The name derives from the popular slang of the time, signifying something exceptional or outstanding.Frank Meier, a renowned bartender at Hôtel Ritz Paris during the 1920s, is credited with creating this drink. It is a variation of the Gin Sour, replacing sugar with honey for a richer flavor profile. This substitution may have been a way to mask the taste of inferior gin commonly available during that era.Thankfully, today's gin market offers a wide selection of high-quality options. Choosing a London Dry gin will emphasize juniper, while a modern gin with citrus and floral notes will highlight the lemon and honey in the cocktail. Feel free to select a gin that best suits your preferences, as it takes center stage in this drink.To create the Bee's Knees, homemade honey syrup is used, blending honey and water to add complexity and sweetness. Fresh lemon juice provides a perfect balance of acidity and brightness.Whether you desire an easy and refreshing cocktail for yourself or need to serve a crowd, the Bee's Knees is an excellent choice. With just three ingredients, it can be quickly prepared for parties and gatherings. Simply keep a bottle of gin, homemade honey syrup, and plenty of lemons on hand, and you'll be ready to shake up this delightful drink for your thirsty guests.","In a shaker filled with ice, combine the gin, lemon juice, and honey syrup.Shake vigorously until well-chilled and the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.Strain the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass.Garnish with a twist of lemon for an extra touch of citrus aroma.Sip and enjoy the refreshing and flavorful Bee’s Knees cocktail.Cheers to this Prohibition-era classic! 🍋🐝🍸", | 2 ounces: gin | 3/4 ounce: lemon juice | 1/2 ounce: honey syrup,Calories: 179kcal | Carbohydrates: 13g | Protein: 0.1g | Fat: 0.1g | Saturated Fat: 0.01g | Sodium: 1mg | Potassium: 30mg | Fiber: 0.1g | Sugar: 12g | Vitamin A: 1IU | Vitamin C: 8mg | Calcium: 2mg | Iron: 0.1mg,There doesn't seem to be an instructional video for this cocktail.

4639,Blue Hawaii Cocktail,"The Blue Hawaii cocktail traces its origins back to the Kaiser Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. In 1957, bartender Harry Yee was approached by a representative of Bols who wanted a drink featuring their blue curaçao liqueur. After experimenting, Yee crafted a delightful blend of rum, vodka, blue curaçao, pineapple, and sweet-and-sour mix, resulting in the iconic blue-colored cocktail we know today.Traditionally, the Blue Hawaii is shaken with ice and strained into a tall glass, but blending all the ingredients together is also an option. Both methods offer a refreshing taste, with the frozen version providing extra relief on hot days.While you can use bottled sweet-and-sour mix, creating your own is a simple way to elevate the cocktail's freshness. All you need is sugar, water, and lime juice to make a homemade sweet-and-sour mix.The Blue Hawaii has gained recognition in popular culture, becoming synonymous with the Aloha State. Yee himself named the drink, inspiring the title of the 1961 Elvis Presley film. While variations exist, such as the Blue Hawaiian with crème de coconut, this authentic recipe remains a must-try for those seeking the true Blue Hawaii experience.Indulge in the tropical paradise of the Blue Hawaii and enjoy its vibrant colors and delightful flavors. Whether you're sipping it in Honolulu or recreating the experience at home, this cocktail is a taste of Hawaiian hospitality. Cheers! 🍹🌺",Pour all ingredients into a shaker and shake thoroughly.

4664,Adios Motherf*cker Cocktail,"Adios Motherf*cker Cocktail also know as the AMF drink is a STRONG cocktail and after a few AFM’s or Adios Mother F you will be saying Adios your self.

If you enjoy a long island iced tea you will probably enjoy this.Ordering an Adios, Motherfucker takes a certain kind of person—one who exudes confidence and isn't afraid to make a bold statement. We're not talking about the watered-down versions like AMF or Adios, Mother F'er. We're talking about the real deal—the full seven-syllable force of an Adios, Motherfucker.This cocktail is not for the faint of heart. It's bold, boozy, and vibrant blue. Similar to a Long Island Iced Tea, it packs a punch with five different alcoholic components. But instead of triple sec and cola, it features a generous pour of blue curaçao and a splash of Sprite or 7UP, giving it that eye-catching color and a lighter, citrusy flavor.To truly make an Adios, Motherfucker, it's important to use homemade sweet-and-sour mix. Bottled versions are often loaded with sugar and additives, so it's best to make your own by combining a quick simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water) infused with fresh lime juice. Garnish your drink with a lemon wedge and cherry if desired, and then confidently enjoy this electrifying cocktail.Remember, what truly makes an Adios, Motherfucker authentic is the person who mixes it—someone who is cool, confident, and uninhibited. That person can be you. Embrace the boldness, embrace the spirit, and embrace the name. Cheers to being a true Adios, Motherfucker.",Pour all ingredients except the Lemonade into a chilled glass filled with ice cubes.Top with Lemonade and stir gently., | .5 oz: Vodka | .5 oz: Rum | .5 oz: Tequila | .5 oz: Gin | .5 oz: Blue Curacao Liqueur | 1 oz: Sours | 2 oz: Lemonade,Calories: 210kcal | Carbohydrates: 14g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 1g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 6mg | Sugar: 12g | Vitamin C: 11mg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9Z3aII2jCo?feature=oembed
