# dashboard-project-DAFT410

*None can ignore the importance of preserving the natural ecosystems that support our civilisation anymore. The dynamic dashboard will help better guide political, personal and business decisions. Complete with links to sources,  the dashboard will bring undeniable information about one's lifestyle and choices and how they impact us all. Dispelling myths and allowing one to balance their lifestyle to minimize their impact all the while maintaining comfort and convenience.*  

## Find interesting datasets and deduce what kind of prediction you want to output.  

## Find which field I'd like work in (or passion/interest) and orient my project towards that.

### Find a machine learning aspect to the project to validate RNCP  
#### Recommender = Clusters
#### Classifier = categories
#### Score/Number output = Regression



## Find what prediction I want to ouput:  
*create custom values/parameters from which the user can chose*  
* recommends a diet and/or lifestyle change
* Calculates & return *"how many Earths would humanity need if everybody lived like that"*  
(your lifestyle footprint per year * how many people on Earth / Earth's resources per year)
* Given diet & lifestyle, predict what age you're likely to pass.  
* Calculate the impact of your lifestyle:  
- Predicter/Recommender
- Interactive dashboard
- CO2 impact & other
  - Transportation
  - Nutrition
  - Consumer habits
- Nutrition Facts per food type
- Transportation
* Given the nature of tweets, are they positive or negative; Have new tweets come in and be classified (per political spectrum, are they fake, are they hateful, the offensiveness of their content)  
(Tweeter API is $100/month !!)
