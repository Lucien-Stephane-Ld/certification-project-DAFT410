as a gin sour it shares a category with other beloved and timetested drinks like the daiquiri a rum sourthe exact origin of the giet remains uncertain but it is believed to have been invented by british sailors in the late 18th century out of necessity the sailors needed a way to prevent scurvy a disease caused by a lack of vitamin c so they mixed lime juice with liquor it didnt take long for them to realize that this concoction was not only beneficial but also incredibly delicious thus while scurvy is now a thing of the past the giet continues to thriveover time the giet found its way into cocktail books including harry craddocks iconic the savoy cocktail book from  featuring various recipes ingredients and proportions while fresh lime juice is the preferred choice today for many years the giet was predominantly made with roses lime cordial a bottled mixture of lime juice and sugar that debuted in the 1860s if you opt for roses in your drink you can omit the simple syrup since the cordial is already sweetened aim for one ounce of roses to achieve the desired balanceits worth noting that the giet can also be made with vodka a practice that gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s however as gin reclaimed its popularity among drinkers it regained its rightful place in the giet gins natural affinity for lime along with its dry and botanical nature adds structure to the
