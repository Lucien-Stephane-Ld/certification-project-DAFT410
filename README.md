# dashboard-project-DAFT410

*Mixology is defined as "the skills to mix cocktails and drinks". My proposed algorythm recommends to users one or more cocktail recipe according to the ingredients you like, and those you have in your home. From there on, the user will acquier a deeper comprehension and can evolve into more complexe cocktails!*  

## Cocktail recommender : according to fruit, alcohol, soft, garnish, sour/sweet.

EXISTING DATASET :  
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/cocktails-hotaling-co (cocktail recipde dataset - 600 cocktails)  

TO WEB SCRAPP :  
- https://www.drinklab.org/cocktail-recipes/  (cocktail recipde sebwite - 10 000 cocktails)

Concat both dataset, dropping redundant ?  
Keep just the 10 000 recipes dataset.  



### Find a machine learning aspect to the project to validate RNCP  
#### Recommender = Clusters
#### Classifier = categories
#### Score/Number output = Regression



## Find what prediction I want to ouput:  
*create custom values/parameters from which the user can chose*  
* recommends a diet and/or lifestyle change
* Calculates & return *"how many Earths would humanity need if everybody lived like that"*  
(your lifestyle footprint per year * how many people on Earth / Earth's resources per year)
* Given diet & lifestyle, predict what age you're likely to pass.  
* Calculate the impact of your lifestyle:  
- Predicter/Recommender
- Interactive dashboard
- CO2 impact & other
  - Transportation
  - Nutrition
  - Consumer habits
- Nutrition Facts per food type
- Transportation
* Given the nature of tweets, are they positive or negative; Have new tweets come in and be classified (per political spectrum, are they fake, are they hateful, the offensiveness of their content)  
(Tweeter API is $100/month !!)

### User interactivity / input :
* No user input in Tableau !! => make predefined profile, or find an extension.
* **Use Streamlit**
